### Leetcode website : 

[15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

### Description

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: []
 
### Idea

the formula: a + b + c = 0. so b+c=-a. At first we should sort the array, and then we compare b+c and -a, if b+c > -a, "b" will take one step forward or b+C < -a, C will take one step back.

Pruning means if a > 0, you can not continue the loops, because a + b + c = 0, a is smallest element, if a > 0 as a result a + b + c also greater than 0.

Key point:

1. Loop
2. pruning
3. Sort

### Solution - Javascript

```javascript
var threeSum = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((min, max) => {
        return min - max
    })
    let result = []
    for (let i = 0; i< nums.length-2; ++i) {
        let j = i+1;
        let k = nums.length-1
        if (nums[i] > 0 )  break
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue
        while (j<k) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < 0) ++j
            else if (nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] > 0) --k
            else if (nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] === 0) {    
                let tmp = [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
                result.push(tmp)
                while(j<k && nums[j] == nums[j+1]) ++j
                while(j<k && nums[k] == nums[k-1]) --k
                ++j
                --k
            }
        }
    }
    return result
};
```

### Solution - C

```c
int comp(const void *a, const void *b) {
    return *(int *)a - *(int *)b;
}

int** threeSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int* returnSize, int** returnColumnSizes){
    int capacity = (numsSize+2)*6;
    int **results = malloc(capacity * sizeof(int *));
    int index = 0;
    *returnColumnSizes = malloc(sizeof(int) * capacity);
    qsort(nums, numsSize, sizeof(int), comp);
    int equalValue = 0;
    for (int i=0; i< numsSize-2; ++i) {
        int j = i+1;
        int k = numsSize-1;
        equalValue = -nums[i];
        if (nums[i] > 0) break;
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
        while (j<k) {
            if (nums[j] + nums[k] > equalValue) --k;
            else if (nums[k] + nums[j] < equalValue) ++j;
            else if (nums[j] + nums[k] == equalValue) {
                results[index] = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
                results[index][0] = nums[i];
                results[index][1] = nums[j];
                results[index][2] = nums[k];
                (*returnColumnSizes)[index] = 3;
                ++index;
                while(j<k &&nums[j] == nums[j+1]) ++j;
                while(j<k &&nums[k] == nums[k-1]) --k;
                ++j; --k;
            }
        }
    }
    *returnSize = index;
    return results;
}
```

### What is the difference between var and let?

The difference is in the level of scope. var is function-scoped, but let (and const) are block-scoped. To understand the difference, check out this example:

```javascript
function doStuff() {
    let a = 5
    var b = 5
    console.log(a+b); // 10
}

doStuff() // 10
console.log(a) // a is not defined
console.log(b) // b is not defined

function doMoreStuff() {
    if (2+2 === 4) {
        var a = 5
        let b = 5
    }
    console.log(a) // 5
    console.log(b) // b is not defined
}

doMoreStuff()

for (let i = 0; i<5; ++i) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}

// Output:  0 1 2 3 4

for (var i = 0; i<5; ++i) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}

// Output:  5 5 5 5 5
```

### What's the difference between == and ===?

```javascript
1 == true; // true
1 > false; // true
0 === false; // false

// Number('true') = NaN (Not a Number), but Number(true) = 1
'true' == true; // false
'true' === true; // false
```

### What does ‘this’ keyword mean?

this keyword is available in any function and points to the object that contains this function

```javascript
const myObject = {
    a: 'b',
    b: 'c',
    doStuff: function() {
        console.log(this.a + this.b)
    }
}

myObject.doStuff(); // bc

const anotherObject = {
    a: 'abacaba',
    b: '!'
};

anotherObject.doStuff = myObject.doStuff
anotherObject.doStuff(); // abacaba!

const arrowObject = {
    a: 'b',
    // this refers to the root function (file itself)
    doMoreStuff: () => console.log(this.a)
};

arrowObject.doMoreStuff(); // undefined
```

### Convert this callback-based call to a Promise-based one

Convert the getData callback function into a Promise:

```

// the function itself
function getData(callback, errorCallback) {
    try {
        callback(result)
    } catch (e) {
        errorCallback(e)
    }
}

// Here is how you would use it:
getData(result => console.log(result), error => console.error(error))

// Here is how to create a Promise-based function from it:
function getDataAsync() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        getData(resolve, reject);
    })
}

getDataAsync().then(result=> console.log(result)).catch(error => console.error(error));

Or

async function main() {
    const result = await getDataAsync();
    console.log(result)
}
```

### What are the primitive data types in JS?

Boolean， Null, undefined, Number, BigInt, String, Symbol 

### 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3?

False, this trick does not apply only to JS，0.1 + 0.2 will be something like 0.300000001。
So we can use Math.abs(0.3 - (0.2 + 0.1)) <= EPS to calculate.

## Tips

What's ``returnSize`` and ``returnColumnSizes`` in Leetcode C template.

```
int** threeSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int* returnSize, int** returnColumnSizes){
    ```
    ```
}
```

returnSize means size of int *a

For example:

int a[10][20];
*returnSize = 10;

returnColumnSizes is made of a one-dimensional array, it stores two-dimensional array's length.

For instance:

*returnSize[0] = 5
*returnSize[1] = 7

the a[0] includes five values : a[0][0] - a[0][4] total 5.
the a[1] includes seven values: a[1][0] - a[1][6] total 7.

So returnSize means a one-dimensional array to stores the two-dimensional array's length.

That's all

## Share - Review HTTP (Part one)

Computer Network is vital knowledge, I just review the Http part to reinforce my understanding about HTTP

### Compared HTTP 0.9 and HTTP 1.0

HTTP 0.9 is a simple protocol, it include Get function, no header, it used to get HTML file.

HTTP 1.0 protocol have a lot of content: header, response code, redirect, conditional request, content coding etc.

How does it work in http 1.0:

The client would send a request to DNS to check IP address, and build an TCP connection (three-way handshake), server will give a response,  four-way handshake to disconnect. 

### About HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2

By HTTP 1.1, the internet browser doesn't to build a TCP connection to all request. it include new features: cache the header extend, Option function, Upgrade header, Range request, compress, transfer coding, channelization. but it doesn't satisfy web coming request, so HTTP2 is launched.

HTTP2 solve an important question that client send all request parallel only by one connection. It include new features: Binary Format、MultiPlexing、header compress、server push etc.

### You are typing an URI, how doesn't it work on browser?

#### You type leviduan.com into the address bar of your browser.
#### The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address of leviduan.com.

DNS is a database that maintains the name of the website and the particular IP address it links to. it's easier to remember the name of the website using a URL and let DNS do the work for us by mapping it to the correct IP.

To find the DNS record, the browser checks four caches.

First, it checks the browser cache. The browser maintains a repository of DNS records for a fixed duration for websites you have previously visited. So, it is the first place to run a DNS query.

Second, the browser checks the OS cache. If it is not in the browser cache, the browser will make a system call to your underlying computer OS to fetch the record since the OS also maintains a cache of DNS records.

Third, it checks the router cache. if it's not on your computer, the browser will communicate with the router that maintains its own cache of DNS records.

Fourth, it checks the ISP cache. If all step fail, the browser will move on to the ISP. Your ISP maintains its own DNS server, which includes a cache of DNS records.

#### If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts leviduan.com

For my computer to connect with the server that hosts leviduan.com, I need the IP address of leviduan.com. The purpose of a DNS query is to search multiple DNS servers on the internet until it finds the correct IP address for the website. This type of search is called a recursive search since the search will repeatedly continue from a DNS server to a DNS server until it either finds the IP address we need or returns an error response saying it was unable to find it.

#### The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server

Once the browser receives the correct IP address, it will build a connection with the server that matches the IP address to transfer information. Browsers use internet protocols to build such connections. There are several different internet protocols that can be used, but TCP is the most common protocol used for many types of HTTP requests.

To transfer data packets between your computer to the server, it is important to have a TCP connection established. This connection is established using a process called the TCP/IP three-way handshake. this is a three-step process where the client and the server exchange SYN and ACK messages to establish a connection.

1.The client machine sends a SYN packet to the server over the internet, asking if it is open for new connection.

2.IF the server has open ports that can accept and initiate new connections, it will respond with an ACKnowledgment of the SYN packet using a SYN/ACK packet.

3.The client will receive the SYN/ACK packet from the server and will acknowledge it by sending an ACK packet.

Then a TCP connection is established for data transmission!

#### The browser sends an HTTP request to the webserver.

Once the TCP connection is established, it is time to start transferring data. The browser will send a GET request asking for leviduan.com web page. If you are entering credentials or submitting a form, this could be a POST request. This request will also contain additional information such as browser identification: User-Agent header, Accept header and connection headers asking it to keep the TCP connection alive for additional requests. It will also pass information taken from cookies the browser has in store for this domain.

#### The server handles the request and sends back a response

The server contains a web's server that receives the request form the browser and passes it to a request handler to read and generate a response. The request handler is a program that reads the request, then it will assemble a response in a JSON/HTML/XML format.

#### The server sends out an HTTP response

The server response contains the web page you requested as well as the status code, compression type, how to cache the page, any cookies to set, privacy information, etc.

something about status code:

1xx indicates an informational message only
2xx indicates success of some kind
3xx redirects the client to another URL
4xx indicates an error on the client's part
5xx indicates an error on the server's part

#### The browser displays the HTML content

The browser displays the HTML content in phases. First, it will render the bare bone HTML skeleton. Then it will check the HTML tags and send out GET requests for additional elements on the web page, such as images, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, etc. These static files are cached by the browser, so it doesn't have to fetch them again the next time you visit the page. In the end, you'll see leviduan.com appearing on your browser.
