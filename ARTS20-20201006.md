## Algorithm 

### Leetcode website : 

[206 Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

### Idea

1.There are three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
2.Iterate through the linked list. In loop, do following.

```
// before changing next of current, store next node
next = curr->next
// Now change next of current, this is where actual reversing happens
curr->next = prev
// Move prev and curr one step forward
prev = curr
curr = next
```

### Solution - Javascript

```javascript
var reverseList = function(head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
    let tmp = null
    let newHead = null
    while(head != null) {
        tmp = head
        head = head.next
        tmp.next = newHead
        newHead = tmp
    }
    return newHead
}
```

### Solution - C

```c
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
 
struct ListNode* reverseList(struct ListNode* head){
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return head;
    struct ListNode *list = NULL;
    struct ListNode *tmp = NULL;
    while (head) {
        tmp = head;
        head = head->next;
        tmp->next = list;
        list = tmp;
    }
    return list;
}
```

## Review

Medium Article:  [Data Structures You Should Know as a JavaScript Developer](https://blog.bitsrc.io/data-structures-you-should-know-as-a-javascript-developer-9a35eb3b319c)

understanding Data Structures is helpful in all aspects of programming, you don't need to have a particular use case where you'll use a Tree or a Graph to have to consider learning about them. But it is most basics from coding.

### Queues

You can insert elements into and take them out following the FIFO approach: First in first out.

```javascript
class Queue {
    data = []
    maxSize

    constructor(initialData, maxSize = -1)  {
        this.data = Array.isArray(initialData) ? initialData : (typeof initialData == "undefined" ? [] : [initialData])
        this.maxSize = maxSize
    }

    isFull () {
        return this.maxSize != -1 ? (this.data.length == this.maxSize) : false
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.data.length === 0
    }

    enqueue(item) {
        if (this.isFull()) {
            return false
        }
        this.data.push(item)
    }

    *gennerator() {
        while(!this.isEmpty) {
            yield this.data.shift()
        }
    }

    dequeue() {
        const {value, done} = this.gennerator().next()
        if (done) return false
        return value
    }
}

const Quene = require('./quenes')
let q = new Quene(3, 2)

q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)

let x = 0
while(x = q.dequeue()) {
    console.log(x)
}
```

Other than the simple queue I'm showing you here, you can also find:

Priority queues, which have their elements internally sorted by a priority value.

Circular queues, which have their last element pointing to the first one.

Double ended queue, which allows you to add and remove elements both from the front and the back.

### Stack

You can think of the data structure as a stack of books if you start putting one on top of the other, once you want to get one, you will have to remove all the books on top of it. This way of handing data is known as FILO, or First In Last out.

```javascript
*generator() {
    while(!this.isEmpty()) {
        yield this.data.pop()
    }
}
```

generator function is the only difference with Queen function.

``pop`` method removes the last added item on the array and returns it.

``shift`` method removes the first added item on the array and returns it.

### Trees

Tree is basically a recursively defined structure formed by a parent node and a number of child nodes connected to one parent.

Sibling nodes (i.e. nodes with the same parent) don't connect with each other.

The tree is normally represented growing downwards (as opposed to a normal tree growing up)

Nodes can't be connected to themselves(I know, it sounds weird but wait until we get to graphs)

```javascript
class BinaryTreeNode {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value
        this.left_child = null
        this.right_child = null
    }

    compare(v) {
        if (this.value > v) return -1
        if (this.value == v) return 0
        if (this.value < v) return 1
    }
}

module.exports = class BST {
    constructor() {
        this.root_node = null
    }

    add (elem) {
        if (!this.root_node) {
            this.root_node = new BinaryTreeNode(elem)
            return
        }
        let inserted = false
        let currentNode = this.root_node
        do {
            let comp = currentNode.compare(elem)
            if (comp == -1) {
                if (!currentNode.left_child) {
                    currentNode.left_child = new BinaryTreeNode(elem)
                    inserted = true
                }
                else {
                    currentNode = currentNode.left_child
                }
            }
            else {
                if (!currentNode.right_child) {
                    currentNode.right_child = new BinaryTreeNode(elem)
                    inserted = true 
                }
                else {
                    currentNode = currentNode.right_child 
                }
            }
        } while (!inserted)
    }

    inorder(parent) {
        if (parent) {
            this.inorder(parent.left_child)
            console.log(parent.value)
            this.inorder(parent.right_child)
        }
    }

    print() {
        this.inorder(this.root_node)
    }
}
```

### Graphs

A graph is a less restricted version of a tree in the sense that there aren't parents and children, rather any node can be related to any other (including themselves).

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value
        this.links = []
    }

    linkTo(node, weight) {
        this.links.push(new link(this, weight, node))
    }
}

class link{
    constructor(a, weight, b) {
        this.left = a;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.right = b;
    }
}

class Graph {
    constructor(root_node) {
        this.root_node = root_node
        this.dfs_visited = new Set();
    }

    dfs(starting_node) {
        if (!starting_node) starting_node = this.root_node
        let node = starting_node
        console.log(node.value)
        this.dfs_visited.add(node)
        node.links.forEach(element => {
            if (!this.dfs_visited.has(element.right)) {
                this.dfs(element.right)
            }
        });
    }
}

let A = new Node("A")
let B = new Node("B")
let C = new Node("C")
let D = new Node("D")
let E = new Node("E")
let F = new Node("F")
let G = new Node("G")

//Define how each node is related to others
A.linkTo(B, 1)
A.linkTo(C, 2)
B.linkTo(D, 1)
C.linkTo(E, 10)
D.linkTo(E, 10)
D.linkTo(F, 1)
D.linkTo(G, 1)
G.linkTo(G, 1)

let g = new Graph(A)
//Traverse the graph
g.dfs()
```

### Hash Map

It allows you to store key-value pairs and retrieve them fairly quickly

```javascript
class HashMap {
    constructor() {
        this.map = {}
    }

    hash(k) {
        return k%10
    }

    add(key, value) {
        let k = this.hash(key)
        if (!this.map[k]) {
            this.map[k] = []
        }
        this.map[k].push(value)
    }

    get(key) {
        let k = this.hash(key)
        return this.map[k]
    }
}

let h = new HashMap()

h.add(10, "hello")
h.add(100001, "world")
h.add(1, "this is a tring")

console.log(h)
```

The output from the above script is:

```
HashMap {
  map: { '0': [ 'hello' ], '1': [ 'world', 'this is a string' ] }
}
```

Notice how both "world" and "this is a string" are associated to the same key, this is what is known as collision. My has method is simply doing a mod 10, to make sure we are keeping up to 10 keys at any given time, no matter what the original key is. This is helpful if you have a limited amount of memory or for some reason need to keep a tight control over the keys. The way you implement your hashing method will determine how effective your hash map ends up being.

## Tips

### Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

var foo = function() {} is quite different than function foo() {};

For all reasons note else where, plus one.

The second example will be hoisted, it will be available anywhere within the current closure (usually the current function). Even before it is declared within said closure.

Something like this would work:

```
function foo() {
    bar()
    function bar() {
        alert('baz')
    }
}
```

Whereas something like this would most definitely not:

```
function foo() {
    bar()
    var bar = function bar() {
        alert('baz')
    }
}
```

You get an error in this second example. because bar has not  been defined yet. If you swap the two lines in the function foo, that example will work.

So I advocate using this second method, because it doesn't contain a hidden behavior like hoisting, your code does exactly what it says it will do, no tricks involved.


## Share - AsyncStorage

AcyncStorage is a key/value-based storage system. It can be easily implemented and is globally available to the app. This persistence system is simple and asynchronous, and also a recommended way to store data. To create an AsyncStorage example application, execute the following command:

```javascript
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, TextInput, Button, AsyncStorage } from 'react-native';

constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { storedText: '', inputBoxText: ''}
}

In constructor we have specified blank values for stredText and inputBoxText, which we will keep updating as and when their state changes.

async componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({storedText: await this.retrieveData()})
}

componentDidMount is invoked only at the time of initial rendering and is responsible for showing the text below "This text is from local storage," once we have updated the storage and refreshed the app again. We have used async and await for calling retrieveData, which means the execution will wait until the function is completely executed.

retrieveData = async() => {
    try {
        const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@AsyncStorageExample: someKey')
        return value;
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error in Fetching Data")
    }
}

The method retrieveData is used to retrieve the value stored in local storage. Calling AsyncStorage.getItem retrieves the value stored in local storage.

onPressSave = async() => {
    try {
        await AsyncStorage.setItem('@AsyncStorageExample:someKey', this.state.inputBoxText);
        this.setState({
            storedText: this.state.inputBoxText
        })
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error is saving data")
    }
}

Updating storage updates AsyncStorage values, which are persisted permanently.
```
